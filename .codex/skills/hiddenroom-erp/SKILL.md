# Hidden Room ERP

## Workflow

1. Identify whether the change is UI-only, query-level, or schema-level.
2. For schema changes, use a Supabase migration and update RLS with the same authorization model.
3. Keep event permissions based on `event_user_permissions` and admin override.
4. Preserve finance semantics: `INGRESO`/`EGRESO`, status values, event keys, counterparties, participations, and membership records.
5. Keep dashboard renderers deterministic and table-friendly; avoid hidden business logic in markup strings.
6. Validate dashboard JS and any SQL migration.
7. Preserve existing role-driven UI behavior for compatibility, but enforce ERP access through protected grants, RLS, scoped permission rows, or internally authorized server code; `users.roles` alone is not a secure boundary while clients can modify sensitive columns.

## Business Domains

- Event finance: `events`, `hr_transactions`, event-specific permissions.
- Memberships and studio sessions: membership deliveries, sessions, weekly cost constants, service/concept options.
- Participations: counterparties and participation percentages for event settlement.
- Tasks/scrum: permission keys such as `scrum.view` and `scrum.edit`.
- User operations: users, contracts, downloads, scores, notifications.

## Guardrails

- Do not bypass RLS by moving sensitive ERP writes to browser-only logic.
- Do not change canonical option strings without a data migration and UI compatibility pass.
- Keep user-facing totals and statuses auditable from database rows.
- Do not migrate or reinterpret existing authorization data without an approved compatibility migration.
