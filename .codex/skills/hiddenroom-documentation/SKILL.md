# Hidden Room Documentation

## Workflow

1. Document the actual repo behavior, not aspirational architecture.
2. Link concrete files, routes, secrets, and commands.
3. Separate public-safe docs from private secrets.
4. Keep steps executable in PowerShell where the repo is maintained on Windows.
5. Update docs next to the feature area: store, cloud agent, design system, Supabase, or changelog.
6. When documenting risks, include validation steps and known limitations.

## Existing Docs

- `README.md`: store, Supabase, and product-specific payment summary.
- `docs/store-setup.md`: store migration, secrets, functions, webhook, panels.
- `docs/cloud-agent-installation.md`: Debian agent install and env vars.
- `docs/mysauth-cloud.md`: custom Cloud UI/API, Debian runtime, security boundary, fallback, and validation.
- Debian production topology facts live in `hiddenroom-debian-server/references/server-map.md`; mirror them into docs only when writing an operational runbook.
- `docs/design-system-status.md`: migration status, risks, quick checks.
- `docs/index.html`: docs landing page.
- `changelog.html`: public changelog route.

## Style

- Prefer concise Spanish when writing user-facing project docs.
- Use exact commands and paths.
- Do not include secret values.
- Include affected routes for manual QA.
