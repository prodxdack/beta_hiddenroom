# Ecosystem Map

## Brand and Public Site

- Root route `/` is the Hidden Room public site.
- Main files: `index.html`, `site.js`, `styles.css`.
- Public messaging in repo includes "La Casa del Under" and Hidden Room as part of Grupo Mysauth.
- Assets live under `assets/img`, `assets/sprites`, and `assets/sounds`.
- `CNAME` maps the static site to `hiddenroom.mx`.

## Frontend Modules

- `/media/`: public media and posts.
  - Files: `media/index.html`, `media/media.js`, `media/post.html`, `media/post.js`, `media/config.js`.
  - Admin/CMS: `media/admin.html`, `media/admin.js`, `media/admin.css`.
- `/store/`: product catalog, cart, checkout, orders, admin.
  - Files: `store/store.js`, `store/admin.js`, `store/*.html`.
  - Beat Store uses Mercado Pago. Other products may use Stripe; payment provider and Edge Function details are product-specific.
- `/tickets/`: event ticket generation, validation, viewing, printing.
  - Files: `tickets/tickets.js`, `tickets/validate.js`, `tickets/view.js`.
- `/kairen/`: Kairen AI UI.
  - Files: `kairen/kairen.js`, `kairen/index.html`.
  - Edge Function: `supabase/functions/kairen-gemini`.
- `/portal/`: auth, recovery, and authenticated dashboard.
  - Files: `portal/login.js`, `portal/recovery.js`, `portal/dashboard.js`, `portal/dashboard.html`.
- `/minijuegos/`: games with local assets.
  - Examples: `flappy_ñero`, `gol_gana`.

## Dashboard, ERP, and CRM-Like Areas

The dashboard is a vanilla SPA in `portal/dashboard.js`. It includes or references:

- Supabase session bootstrap.
- Role-composable navigation.
- Client/profile areas.
- Notifications.
- Scores and local game sync.
- ERP/event finance.
- Memberships and studio sessions.
- Tasks/scrum-style operations.
- Admin tables.
- Cloud file manager.

The repo does not contain enough explicit business context to fully define CRM policy. Ask the user before defining customer lifecycle, segmentation, lead stages, sales process, or support policy.

## Supabase

Primary folders:

- `supabase/migrations/`
- `supabase/functions/`
- `supabase/config.toml`
- `supabase/database.types.ts`
- `database.types.ts`
- `supabase/db-columns.txt`
- `supabase/db-policies.txt`
- `supabase/db-functions.txt`
- `supabase/db-rls.txt`

Known domains:

- Auth/profile sync: `users`, auth triggers, admin user functions.
- Store: `store_products`, `store_orders`, `store_order_items`, `store_downloads`, RPC fulfillment.
- Media: `media_posts`, cover storage.
- Tickets: `event_tickets`, events.
- ERP: `events`, `hr_transactions`, `event_user_permissions`, counterparties, participations, tasks, sessions, contracts, downloads, scores.
- Cloud: `cloud_jobs`, `cloud-staging`.

## Security and Permissions

- Browser uses Supabase anon/publishable key only.
- Service role belongs only in Edge Functions or Debian agent.
- RLS is the real authorization boundary.
- Existing admin checks use helpers such as `is_admin()` and role/permission tables, but these are not a secure boundary by themselves while clients can modify sensitive role columns.
- Event finance is scoped by `event_user_permissions`.
- Media admin can use admin role or `media.posts` permission.
- Cloud manager requires admin role and never exposes direct SSH/filesystem access.

## Infrastructure Known From Repo

- GitHub Pages-compatible static hosting is implied by static architecture and `CNAME`.
- Supabase project URL appears in source as `https://rpcunbkstadgngqrjafp.supabase.co`.
- Public site URL appears as `https://hiddenroom.mx`.
- Cloud public URL example: `https://cloud.hiddenroom.mx/files`.
- Debian production cloud root discovered as `/home/prodxdack/hiddenroom`.
- Agent install example path: `/opt/mysauth/mysauth-cloud-agent.js`.
- Live Debian agent path discovered as `/home/prodxdack/mysauth-agents/cloud-agent/agent.js`.
- Live cloud routing is Cloudflare Tunnel `hiddenroom-cloud` -> `http://localhost:8080` -> MysAuth Cloud Node app. Docker File Browser is the local fallback on `127.0.0.1:8081`; Nginx was not found in the active path. `hiddenroom-debian-server/references/server-map.md` is authoritative.
- User-provided business context documents Cloudflare as the entry point for DNS, SSL, protection, cache, security rules, and domain management.
- User-provided business context documents the Debian server as the self-owned compute layer for agents, automation, scheduled processes, custom APIs, Node.js services, integrations, future workloads outside Supabase, and Cloud.

Use `hiddenroom-debian-server` for current live host details. Ask before assuming Cloudflare zone settings not visible from the Debian host, such as dashboard SSL mode, DNS records outside the tunnel, cache rules, WAF rules, Workers, or upload-size overrides.
